# Who am I (Javier)

* Where are you from?
-I'm from Vitoria-gasteiz, Spain

* Do you have previous experience with technology/data?
-As long as using a microwave is previous experience with technology, yes I do

# Why am I here

* What has brought you to Ironhack?
-Just a random search on google (I wanted to know what would I be doing on summer holidays) showed me 
something about a bootcamp scholarship for the summer so I tried, and I'm here right now

* What knowledge/skills do you expect to learn in this bootcamp?
-I expect to improve my (almost none) programming skills, getting introduced to the 'Data World' 
and to prepare myself with both, experience and learning about this subjetc (and if it is possible, a job could make the difference)

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* Which industry will you seek employment in?
-I'm still not sure as I do not really know this subject so well, but I would like to try something related to 
investigation or new techs development 

* What will your future role look like?
I would love to be a lead researcher in a company working on developing AIs or something related, 
but actually it is really early I guess so I have not a stabished role I want to be.

* What is your career goal?
-It is pretty normal I guess, something i like, useful for others and well paid, I would say 
"not really ambicious tho" but nowadays I would ave to check it...
